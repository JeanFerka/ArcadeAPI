# Arcadeâ€™s documentation


## How to implement game libraries:

The game logic must be separate from rendering.
Game logic must be handled by game libraries and rendering by graphic libraries.

Your game libraries must implement the following interface:

```cpp
namespace Arcade {
    class IGameModule {
        public:
            virtual ~IGameModule() = default;

            virtual void update(std::vector<Event> events) = 0;

            virtual std::vector<IDrawable> getDrawables() = 0;
    }
}
```

They must also implement the following symbol, that returns an instance of the class implementing the interface.

```cpp
// Symbol that your game libraries must define

extern "C" {
    ArcadeIGameModule *getGame();
}
```

The related types and structures are available in the header files contained in the Arcade folder.


## How to implement graphics libraries:

The graphics libraries must provide practical symbols to display any kind of object.
They must also provide a function that returns the system events.

Your graphics libraries must implement the following interface:

```cpp
namespace Arcade {
    class IDisplayModule {
        public:
            virtual ~IDisplayModule() = default;

            virtual void drawPixel(Color color, Vector2<float> pos) = 0;
            virtual void drawLine(Color color, Vector2<float> beg, Vector2<float> end) = 0;
            virtual void drawRectangle(Vector2<float> size, Vector2<float> pos, Color color) = 0;
            virtual void drawCircle(float radius, Color color) = 0;
            virtual void drawText(const std::string &text, Vector2<float> pos, Color color) = 0;

            virtual std::vector<Event> getEvents() = 0;
    }
}
```

They must also implement the following symbol, that returns an instance of the class implementing the interface.

```cpp
// Symbol that your graphics libraries must define

extern "C" {
    ArcadeIDisplayModule *getDisplay();
}
```

The related types and structures are available in the header files contained in the Arcade folder.
